It's spring, Easter is coming. Mama Bunny is getting ready, too, and she's collecting watering poems for the little bunny boys. (Easter watering is very kind special Easter monday morning custom.)  Such poems as "Red eggs, green and white bunny, two kisses for a watering Bunny boy!"

Of course, there are those who know it a little differently.

The C language application helps Mama Bunny to record the watering poems (add a new poem), list the poems she already knows, delete if necessary and modify an existing poem.

The poems are stored in a data file.

Now, Mama Bunny has also prepared a collection of watering poems for the little bunny boys. Easter is in full swing and the boys are getting ready to water.

Mama Bunny (parent) keeps the watering poems in a file. When she hears a new poem, she continues to record it, possibly modifying it, but she chooses (at random) the most talented of the 4 bunny boys (children) and sends them to water the girls of the Bunny Family in the Friendly Bunny family in Barátfa. This Watering option should appear as a new menu item next to the previous ones. When the bunny boy arrives in Barátfa, he sends a signal to the mother, who in response sends 2 poems to the boy through a pipe. The boy writes these poems on the screen and then chooses one (random number). The chosen poem is sent back to mummy on a message queue. (This poem is not used later.) Then bunny boy tells the poem in Friend Tree (he writes it on the screen and then adds: "May I water! Then he waters the girls and returns home to Mama Bunny (terminal).
